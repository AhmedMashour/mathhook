sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    Explanation
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    ===========
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    This function takes a system of ODEs as an input, determines if the
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    it is solvable by this function, and returns the solution if found any.
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    This function can handle:
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    1. Linear, First Order, Constant coefficient homogeneous system of ODEs
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    2. Linear, First Order, Constant coefficient non-homogeneous system of ODEs
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    3. Linear, First Order, non-constant coefficient homogeneous system of ODEs
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    4. Linear, First Order, non-constant coefficient non-homogeneous system of ODEs
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    5. Any implicit system which can be divided into system of ODEs which is of the above 4 forms
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    6. Any higher order linear system of ODEs that can be reduced to one of the 5 forms of systems described above.
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    The types of systems described above are not limited by the number of equations, i.e. this
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    function can solve the above types irrespective of the number of equations in the system passed.
sympy/solvers/ode/systems.py-    But, the bigger the system, the more time it will take to solve the system.
