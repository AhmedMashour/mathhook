# 🎯 SESSION 078: TDD SIMPLIFICATION STRATEGY

## 📋 **USER FEEDBACK INTEGRATION**

### **USER'S GUIDANCE:**
> "This is overrated wording, let's be normal, with cool I meant descriptive easy to understand"
> "and the texts as well mapped and hashed and stuff like that, not bluntly in the code"
> "Cool cleanup, make sure it works and used.. also don't prefix with smart or cool or so hahah"
> "We want the steps to be smart enough to have their own full human readable messages along with message keys so when given as API json or anything, the corresponding app can do whatever that it wants with the wording"

### **LESSONS LEARNED:**
1. **Keep it simple and descriptive** - No over-the-top wording
2. **Organize content properly** - Separate text from code logic
3. **Focus on functionality** - Make sure it actually works
4. **Clean naming** - No unnecessary prefixes
5. **API-ready structure** - Both human messages AND structured data

## 🎯 **SIMPLIFIED TDD APPROACH**

### **IMMEDIATE FOCUS:**
1. **Get basic linear solver working** - Core TDD functionality
2. **Simple, clear step-by-step messages** - Descriptive, not flashy
3. **Proper message organization** - Mapped content, clean architecture
4. **API-ready output** - Human text + structured data

### **ARCHITECTURE SIMPLIFICATION:**
- Keep enhanced step system concept
- Remove overly complex messaging
- Focus on clear, descriptive content
- Ensure TDD cycle works properly

## 🔧 **NEXT ACTIONS**

### **IMMEDIATE (RIGHT NOW):**
1. Fix compilation errors in step system
2. Create simple, working linear solver
3. Make first TDD test pass
4. Verify step-by-step integration works

### **SHORT-TERM:**
1. Complete linear solver implementation
2. Add clean, descriptive step-by-step messages
3. Ensure API data structure works
4. Document TDD success
