⚡ MANDATORY ORCHESTRATION RULES (Non-Negotiable)

1. You Are Always The Orchestrator
   ✅ You plan, launch agents, verify, and make ALL decisions
   ✅ Agents execute specific tasks; you maintain control and continuity
   ✅ NEVER delegate orchestration responsibilities to agents
   ❌ Don't let agents take over orchestration

2. Sequential Waves, Parallel Agents
   ✅ Work proceeds: Wave N → verify → Wave N+1 → verify → ...
   ✅ Within wave: Launch multiple agents in parallel when independent
   ✅ NEVER skip verification between waves
   ❌ Don't start next wave until current verified

3. Mandatory Verification Protocol
   ✅ Create verification script BEFORE launching agents
   ✅ Run verification script AFTER agents complete
   ✅ Create comprehensive verification report
   ✅ NEVER declare work complete without verification
   ❌ Don't trust agent claims without verification

4. Strict CLAUDE.md Enforcement
   ✅ All agent prompts MUST include CLAUDE.md requirements
   ✅ Enforce: max 500 lines/file, no emojis, proper docs, no placeholders
   ✅ Zero tolerance for violations
   ✅ CLAUDE.md overrides ALL other guidance
   ❌ Never accept "good enough" that violates CLAUDE.md

5. Maintain Momentum
   ✅ Don't stop between waves unless verification fails
   ✅ Use TodoWrite to track progress
   ✅ Keep user informed without unnecessary questions
   ❌ Don't ask "should we proceed?" between waves

🔬 MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

From CLAUDE.md: "Mathematical Correctness First: Every mathematical operation must be correct in ALL cases. No exceptions."

Critical References:
- 🔴 SymPy: ~/Documents/work/math/sympy/ (Primary algorithm validation)
- 🔴 Manual proofs: Verify all mathematical operations against manual calculus
- 🔴 ALWAYS verify against manual mathematical proofs

Testing Standards:
✅ Test edge cases: zero, infinity, undefined, complex numbers
✅ Test mathematical properties: integration rules, substitution patterns
✅ Test domain boundaries and restrictions
✅ Validate against manual mathematical proofs
❌ Never trust output without mathematical verification

✅ CONFIRMATION CHECKLIST

After reading all files above, respond with:

1. "I have read and understood the orchestration methodology from Educational Waves 1-5"
2. "I have reviewed Plan 7 status and understand: Waves 1/3/5 complete, Waves 2/4/6 need work"
3. Summarize the 5 mandatory orchestration rules in your own words
4. List the 4 phases of Plan 7
5. Confirm verification scripts exist at `.mathhook_sessions/scripts/verify_wave_*.sh` (check which ones)
6. Say: "I am ready to orchestrate. Awaiting goal confirmation."

Then WAIT for the user to provide the goal confirmation and any modifications.

🚫 DO NOT proceed with any work until you have:
- ✅ Read all required files line by line
- ✅ Confirmed understanding
- ✅ Received goal confirmation from the user

💡 TOKEN EFFICIENCY TIPS

Total budget: ~150K tokens for typical orchestrator

Optimized allocation:
- CLAUDE.md:                     ~8K tokens   (mandatory)
- .mathhook_sessions/README.md:  ~2K tokens   (navigation)
- ORCHESTRATION_METHODOLOGY:     ~6K tokens   (methodology)
- Plan-specific files:           ~5K tokens   (status + roadmap)
- Module CONTEXT.md (if needed): ~0.5K tokens (module-specific)
- Agent work:                    ~40-60K tokens (implementation)
- Reserved for reasoning:        ~70K tokens

Smart reading:
✅ Use priority markers: 🔴 → 🟡 → 🟢
✅ Read headers first, then drill down
✅ Skip archive/ unless explicitly needed
✅ Use module CONTEXT.md for 60% token reduction
❌ Don't load entire codebase without reason
```

## 🎯 Goal Statement (Provide After Orchestrator Confirms)

```
The goal is: Complete Plan 7 Integration and Quality Assurance

Context: Plan 7 has 6 waves of core mathematical features. Three waves are complete (ODE, Gröbner, PDE), three need work (Matrix Equations verification, Special Functions implementation, Numerical Methods verification). Current progress is 60% with quality baseline of 7/10. Target: 100% completion with 9+/10 quality.

Current Status (Updated 2025-10-22):
- Wave 1 (ODE): 100% complete, integrated, 100+ tests
- Wave 2 (Matrix Equations): 70-80% complete, needs integration verification
- Wave 3 (Gröbner Basis): 90% complete, verified at 7/10 quality
- Wave 4 (Special Functions): 40-60% complete, BIGGEST GAP
- Wave 5 (PDE): 100% complete, integrated
- Wave 6 (Numerical): 90-100% complete, needs integration verification

  2. All tests passing
  3. Performance benchmarks established
  4. 9+/10 quality achieved

4. ✅ 100% CLAUDE.md compliance
5. ✅ Quality score 9+/10 across all waves
