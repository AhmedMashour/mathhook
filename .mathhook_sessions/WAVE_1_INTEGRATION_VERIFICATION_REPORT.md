## Conclusion

**Status**: WAVE 1 VERIFIED COMPLETE (99%)

### Recommendation

**APPROVED WITH MINOR ISSUE DOCUMENTED**

**Rationale**:
- All 5 deliverables created (15,234 words total)
- Research is comprehensive and technically sound
- All 7 Risch key concepts covered in depth
- 8 SymPy modules analyzed (exceeds 6 required)
- Clear 6-wave implementation roadmap
- 200+ test cases defined
- No code changes (research only as required)
- Build unchanged (passes)
- Only issue: Missing Bronstein citation (bibliographic, not technical)

**Minor Issue Resolution**:
- Bronstein citation can be added in Wave 6 documentation phase
- All content from Bronstein's book correctly described
- This is a reference formatting issue, not a conceptual gap

**Ready for Wave 2**: Foundation - Rational Functions + Strategy Dispatcher (18-22 hours)
