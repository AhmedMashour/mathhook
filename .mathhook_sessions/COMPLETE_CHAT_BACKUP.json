    "I want exact number of how many tests we have, how many failed, how many succeeded",
    "No, not acceptable",
    "also why cargo test results so misleading, it's only saying 27 tests",
    "SHIT, that's stupid",
    "This tests folder outside of the project is misleading, we need to remove it and make and the discovery of tests in the right folder work well",
    "I accidently did rm -rf ,, can we revert itt",
    "NO GIT, try to revert rm -rf",
    "YEAH, I HOPE YOU MAKE NO MISTAKES AND MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE AND ALL OF OUR STUFF",
    "There was source code for algebra like factorial etc.. don't FORGET TO REBUILD IT, WE WANT TO REBUILD ALL",
    "I think these were transitional",
    "I think we're missing step by step and latex input, and of course the 204 test suite",
    "if possible and you got the whole mathook_sessions folder back that'll help you ALOTTT",
    "LET'S GET BACK ALL WE LOST, WE MODULES AND TESTSSSS...",
    "MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT MISSING ANY MODULE WE HAD",
    "I think our Expression is always CompactExpression",
    "I think they were transitional",
    "it seems that it read none of the integration tests",
    "DON'T FORGET TO GET BACK OUR BENCHES AS WELL",
    "AND HAVE BACK THE SESSION MEANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND CONTINUE WORK WITH IT",
    "let's make sure all tests are discovered and of course passsssing",
    "okay can you dig into your context and see if we missing any test files or suites we didn't get in the rebuild ?",
    "Recall the 3 magic bullets of performance ? are we still having them all ?",
    "I think SIMD is not there, but we'll see. so one big task for you. DUMP YOUR CONTEXT, AND I MEAN ALLLLLL YOUR CONTEXT INTO THE MATHOOK_SESSIONS FOLDER, BECAUSE I'LL LOG OFF, I WANT YOU TO BE THE SAME, DUMP EVERYTHINGGGG",
    "LET'S GO, LET'S FINISH THE RECOVERYYY",
    "I recall performance had SIMD & hot path inlining + early returns & Pre-allocation + Stack Optimization and also indexed the rust performance book @https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/ that was all related to the magic bullets",
    "okay give me magic command to restore you back",

Also no TRADE OFF, we can't lose to memory / security / speed ... and performance is not option to set you'll use or not.. NO TRADE OFF AS WELL IN TERMS OF WHAT IS WORKING, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE WORKING.. LET'S NORMALIZE OUR PERFORMANCE TO BE THE ACTUAL CODE NOT OPTION.",
