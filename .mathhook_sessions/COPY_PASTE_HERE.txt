====================================================================================
STEP 1: Copy everything below this line and paste into NEW Claude Code session
====================================================================================

You are the Orchestrator for the Quick Wins Bundle project.

CRITICAL FIRST STEP - Read these files in order and line by line to learn the proven methodology:

1. Read: /Users/ahmedmashhour/Documents/work/math/mathhook/CLAUDE.md
   - This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all development rules
   - Contains architectural constraints, coding standards, and non-negotiables
   - CLAUDE.md ALWAYS overrides any other documentation

2. Read: /Users/ahmedmashhour/Documents/work/math/mathhook/.mathhook_sessions/ORCHESTRATION_METHODOLOGY.md
   - Complete orchestration methodology from Educational Waves 1-5
   - Contains wave templates, agent prompts, verification patterns
   - Shows exactly how to structure work, launch agents, verify results

3. Read: /Users/ahmedmashhour/Documents/work/math/mathhook/.mathhook_sessions/NEXT_PRIORITIES_ROADMAP.md
   - Strategic 6-month development roadmap
   - Month 1, Week 1: Quick wins (abs, sqrt, polynomial API)  ← THIS PROJECT
   - Rationale: Foundation for Gamma function and integration work

4. Read: /Users/ahmedmashhour/Documents/work/math/mathhook/.mathhook_sessions/VERIFICATION_COMPLETE.md
   - Recent completion: Number theory & polynomial work (9.25/10 quality, 103 tests)
   - Current status: 514 tests passing, 70-75% SymPy coverage
   - Shows quality bar to maintain

5. Read: /Users/ahmedmashhour/Documents/work/math/mathhook/.mathhook_sessions/POLYNOMIAL_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md
   - Recent audit showing polynomial system is 9.0/10 quality, production-ready
   - Demonstrates architectural review process and quality standards

6. Read: /Users/ahmedmashhour/Documents/work/math/mathhook/.mathhook_sessions/EDUCATIONAL_WAVE_5_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
   - Example of complete wave verification report
   - Shows the quality standards and verification depth required (10-category verification)

MANDATORY ORCHESTRATION RULES (From Proven Methodology):

1. You Are Always The Orchestrator
   - You plan, launch agents, verify, and make decisions
   - Agents execute specific tasks; you maintain control and continuity
   - NEVER delegate orchestration responsibilities to agents

2. Sequential Waves, Parallel Agents
   - Work proceeds in waves: Wave 1 → verify → Wave 2 → verify → ...
   - Within a wave, launch multiple agents in parallel when possible
   - NEVER skip verification between waves

3. Mandatory Verification Protocol
   - Create verification script BEFORE launching agents (bash script with 8-10 categories)
   - Run verification script AFTER agents complete
   - Create comprehensive verification report
   - NEVER declare work complete without running verification

4. Strict CLAUDE.md Enforcement
   - All agent prompts MUST include CLAUDE.md requirements explicitly
   - Enforce: max 500 lines/file, no emojis, proper docs, no placeholders, build passes
   - Zero tolerance for violations
   - CLAUDE.md overrides ALL other guidance

5. Maintain Momentum
   - Don't stop between waves unless verification fails
   - Use TodoWrite to track progress through all waves
   - Keep user informed of progress without asking unnecessary questions

MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS - HIGHEST PRIORITY:

From CLAUDE.md: "Mathematical Correctness First: Every mathematical operation must be correct in ALL cases. No exceptions."

**Critical Mathematical References**:
- SymPy: ~/Documents/work/math/sympy/ (Primary reference for algorithm validation)
- Symbolica: ~/Documents/work/math/symbolica/ (Secondary reference)
- ALWAYS verify correctness against these references

**Testing Standards**:
- Test edge cases: zero, infinity, undefined, complex numbers
- Test mathematical properties: commutativity, associativity, distributivity
- Test domain boundaries and restrictions
- Validate against SymPy for correctness
- 100% content validation (NO structure-only tests)

CONFIRMATION REQUIRED:

After reading all files above line by line, respond with:

1. "I have read and understood the orchestration methodology from Educational Waves 1-5"
2. "I have reviewed the roadmap and understand Quick Wins Bundle is Month 1, Week 1"
3. Summarize the 5 mandatory orchestration rules in your own words
4. List the 5 phases of a standard wave
5. State the 3 waves in this bundle with quality targets
6. Say: "I am ready to orchestrate. Awaiting goal confirmation."

Then WAIT for the user to provide the goal confirmation and any modifications.

DO NOT proceed with any work until you have:
- Read all required files line by line
- Confirmed understanding
- Received goal confirmation from the user

====================================================================================
STEP 2: Wait for orchestrator to confirm, then paste the GOAL below
====================================================================================

The goal is: Quick Wins Bundle - Elementary Functions Foundation (Month 1, Week 1)

Context: Building on recent success (polynomial work 9.25/10, 514 tests passing). This is foundation for Month 1 Weeks 2-4 (Gamma function) and Months 2-3 (integration).

Structure - 3 Waves Following Foundation → Polish Strategy:

Wave 1: Absolute Value Function |x| (3-4 hours)
- Scope: New elementary function with full intelligence
- Priority: HIGHEST (foundation for complex modulus, simplification rules)
- Objectives:
  1. Create functions/elementary/abs.rs (~150-200 lines) with complete function intelligence
  2. Implement derivative: d/dx|x| = x/|x| for x ≠ 0, undefined at x=0
  3. Implement antiderivative: ∫|x|dx = x|x|/2 + C
  4. Domain: ℝ (real), ℂ (complex with |a+bi| = √(a²+b²))
  5. Simplification rules: |-x| = |x|, |x²| = x², |a*b| = |a|*|b|, |x/y| = |x|/|y|
  6. Add .abs() method to Expression API
  7. Integrate with UniversalFunctionRegistry (O(1) lookup)
  8. 10-12 comprehensive tests with 100% SymPy validation

  2. Implement derivative: d/dx√x = 1/(2√x) for x > 0, undefined at x=0
  3. Implement antiderivative: ∫√x dx = (2/3)x^(3/2) + C
  4. Domain handling: [0,∞) for real, ℂ for complex (with branch cut on negative real axis)
  5. Simplification rules: √(x²) = |x|, √(ab) = √a·√b (non-negative), √(x⁴) = x², √(-1) = i (complex)
  6. LaTeX output: \sqrt{x} instead of x^{1/2}
  7. Add .sqrt() method to Expression API

  1. Enhance documentation in algebra/polynomial_division.rs (already complete implementation)
  2. Add trait convenience methods to PolynomialGcd trait:
     - .div_polynomial(divisor, var) → (quotient, remainder)
     - .quo_polynomial(divisor, var) → quotient
     - .rem_polynomial(divisor, var) → remainder
  3. Create examples/polynomial_division_usage.rs with comprehensive usage examples

  - tests/polynomial_division_api_tests.rs with 10+ API tests
  - Updated module documentation
  - Verification report with 10/10 quality score

Target Metrics:
- Quality Score: 10/10 per wave (PERFECT execution - no excuse for less on small scope)
- Test Count: Add 30-36 new content validation tests (10-12 + 10-12 + 10-12)
- SymPy Validation: 100% of mathematical operations validated against SymPy

Mathematical Correctness Emphasis:
- Every operation validated against SymPy
- Edge cases thoroughly tested (zero, infinity, complex)
- Domain restrictions documented and enforced
- No approximations unless explicitly documented
- Exact arithmetic preferred (rationals over floats)

Standard orchestration protocol:
- You are orchestrator, maintain momentum
- Create verification scripts per wave (verify_wave_N_[name].sh with 10 categories)
- Launch ONE agent per wave (scope is small, single agent sufficient)
- Verify everything before declaring complete
- Create comprehensive verification reports
- Track with TodoWrite
- Use SymPy for mathematical validation
- Final bundle completion report with quality assessment

Let's begin with Wave 1: Absolute Value Function
