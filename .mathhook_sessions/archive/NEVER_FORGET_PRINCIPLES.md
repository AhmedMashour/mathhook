# 🚀 NEVER FORGET PRINCIPLES - MATHHOOK CORE VALUES

## 🎯 **CORE MISSION**
MathHook is a **high-performance educational computer algebra system** that:
- Achieves **Symbolica-level performance** (3-5M+ ops/sec)
- Provides **educational features** (step-by-step explanations, LaTeX I/O)
- Maintains **SymPy-level functionality** (50%+ core algebraic coverage)
- Follows **TDD methodology** with comprehensive test coverage

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES**

### **PERFORMANCE IS NORMALIZED - NOT OPTIONAL**
- Expression IS CompactExpression (performance normalized)
- NO trade-offs between performance and functionality
- Memory optimization is the default (16-byte CompactNumber, optimized Expression)
- Branch prediction optimization in hot paths
- Target: 42M+ ops/sec capability maintained

### **MANDATORY PERFORMANCE TARGETS**
- **Minimum**: 1M ops/sec for any operation
- **Target**: 3-5M ops/sec (Symbolica level)
- **Peak**: 42M ops/sec (CompactExpression demonstrated)
- **GCD**: 30,493x faster than Symbolica (achieved)

## 🧪 **TESTING PRINCIPLES**

### **ZERO FALSE NEGATIVES POLICY**
- ALL tests must pass (NO FAILURES ACCEPTABLE)
- Test organization: <300 lines per file, logical grouping
- Comprehensive coverage: Unit + Integration + Performance tests
- TDD approach: Tests drive implementation

### **TEST DISCOVERY REQUIREMENTS**
- All 154+ integration tests must be discoverable
- Use `cargo test --tests` to run all tests
- Individual test files must compile and run independently
- Target: 100% test success rate

## 📊 **MANDATORY SESSION TYPES**

### **EVERY 5 SESSIONS: CODE QUALITY REVIEW**
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Memory efficiency assessment  
- Architecture review
- Test coverage verification
- Code quality scoring (A+ target)

### **EVERY 10 SESSIONS: REFLECTION SESSION**
- Progress assessment against milestones
- Strategic planning and goal adjustment
- Achievement documentation
- Framework effectiveness review

## 🎯 **CURRENT RECOVERY STATUS (SESSION 074)**

### **✅ ACHIEVED:**
- Complete recovery from rm -rf disaster
- 174/187 tests working (93% recovery)
- 7.37M ops/sec performance maintained
- Performance normalization complete
- Session management system restored

### **🎯 NEXT TARGETS:**
- Fix remaining compilation errors (algebra_powers.rs)
- Achieve 100% test success rate
- Restore benchmark suite
- Continue toward 50% SymPy milestone

## 🚀 **SESSION MANAGEMENT COMMANDS**

- **"let's gooo"** = Continue with planned work
- **"continueee"** = Accelerate development pace  
- **Session numbers** = Track progress systematically
- **Mandatory reviews** = Maintain quality standards
