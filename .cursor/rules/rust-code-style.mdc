description: # Rust Code Style Rules
alwaysApply: true

## Comments and Documentation
- Use only documentation comments (`///` for functions, `//!` for modules)
- Exception: Inline comments allowed for mathematical equations/expressions (e.g., `// 2x + 1`, `// ax^2 + bx + c`)
- No emojis in code, comments, or documentation
- No ALL CAPS text in code or documentation
- Always include testable examples in `///` documentation that compile and run as doctests

## Code Quality
- Keep code clean, professional, and self-documenting through good naming and structure
- Focus on functionality over visual flair in documentation
- Write meaningful variable and function names that explain intent

## Module Organization
- Split modules into individual files when they exceed 500 lines
- Use individual file approach (e.g., `derivatives/power_rule.rs`, `derivatives/chain_rule.rs`)
- Avoid mod.rs pattern for sub-modules

## Testing
- Add meaningful unit tests in each module
- Test core functionality without being brittle
- Avoid tests that are overly specific to implementation details
- Focus on behavior verification over implementation testing
