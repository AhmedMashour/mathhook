# MathHook Project Structure Rules

## Comments and Documentation

- Use only documentation comments (`///` for functions, `//!` for modules)

- Exception: Inline comments allowed for mathematical equations/expressions (e.g., `// 2x + 1`, `// ax^2 + bx + c`)

- No emojis in code, comments, or documentation

- No ALL CAPS text in code or documentation

- Always include testable examples in `///` documentation that compile and run as doctests

## Code Quality

- Keep code clean, professional, and self-documenting through good naming and structure

- Focus on functionality over visual flair in documentation

- Write meaningful variable and function names that explain intent

- DONT MAKE TODO OR SAYING FOR NOW - IF SOMETHING NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION YOU IMPLEMENT IT

## File Organization
- Core mathematical types in `src/core/`
- Algebraic operations in `src/algebra/`
- Calculus operations in `src/calculus/`
- Educational features in `src/educational/`
- Equation solvers in `src/algebra/solvers/`
- Tests mirror source structure in `tests/`

## Module Size Limits
- Maximum 500 lines per module file
- Split larger modules into focused sub-modules
- Each sub-module should have a single responsibility
- Avoid mod.rs pattern for sub-modules

## Documentation Structure
- Session notes in `.mathhook_sessions/`
- Technical documentation with examples
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Complete API documentation with doctests

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in each module
- Integration tests in `tests/` directory
- Performance tests for critical paths
- TDD approach for equation solvers
- Maintain 100% solver test success rate
- Add meaningful unit tests in each module
- Test core functionality without being brittle
- Avoid tests that are overly specific to implementation details
- Focus on behavior verification over implementation testing
