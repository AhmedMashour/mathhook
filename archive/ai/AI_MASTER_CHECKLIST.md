# 🎯 AI MASTER CHECKLIST - HOW WE CODE IN MATHHOOK

## 📋 **AI SELF-PROMPTING INSTRUCTIONS**

**WHEN YOU READ THIS FILE, YOU MUST:**
1. Follow ALL checklists in order
2. Update progress as you complete items
3. Document EVERYTHING step-by-step
4. Preserve user's exact words and requirements
5. NEVER skip the TDD approach when implementing new modules

## 🏗️ **MASTER DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST**

### **PHASE 1: PLANNING & SETUP** ✅
- [x] Session documentation created
- [x] TDD approach documented  
- [x] User requirements captured verbatim
- [x] Module selection justified (Equation Solvers)
- [x] Coverage analysis completed
- [ ] Master checklist created (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Step-by-step checklist created
- [ ] Modular checklist created

### **PHASE 2: TDD IMPLEMENTATION** 🔄
- [ ] Comprehensive failing test suite created
- [ ] All tests verified to fail (as expected)
- [ ] Module architecture designed
- [ ] Implementation started (one test at a time)
- [ ] Each test made to pass incrementally
- [ ] Full module functionality achieved

### **PHASE 3: INTEGRATION & OPTIMIZATION** ⏳
- [ ] Module integrated with existing codebase
- [ ] Performance benchmarks added
- [ ] Magic Bullets optimization applied
- [ ] Zero warnings maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated

### **PHASE 4: VALIDATION & COMPLETION** ⏳
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] SymPy compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Session documentation completed
- [ ] Next session prepared

## 🎯 **CURRENT SESSION STATUS**

**SESSION 078: TDD EQUATION SOLVERS**
- **Status**: Phase 1 - Planning & Setup
- **Next Action**: Create failing test suite
- **User Requirement**: TDD approach with comprehensive documentation

**USER'S EXACT WORDS:**
> "okay, what we'll go with sympy is TDD approach, we pick the module we'll go for, we pick its tests.. make all the module tests, expect they'll all fail, then and only then we start making them work by implementing the code based on architecture and structure, document everything step by step in the mathhook_sessions and management, also document my wordings"

> "Yeah, let's go also make a master_checklist and also step by step checklist and also modular checklist, and put the rules for you to maintain them, all that should be document for you so you get them back when you re-read the files.. don't just add to your context, make files prompting yourself on how we code here"

## 📝 **AI MAINTENANCE RULES**

### **CHECKLIST MAINTENANCE RULES:**
1. **UPDATE IMMEDIATELY**: Mark items complete as soon as finished
2. **DOCUMENT PROGRESS**: Add timestamps and details for major items
3. **PRESERVE CONTEXT**: Never lose user requirements or decisions
4. **CROSS-REFERENCE**: Link between master, step-by-step, and modular checklists
5. **VERSION CONTROL**: Update session files with each major change

### **DOCUMENTATION RULES:**
1. **USER VOICE FIRST**: Always preserve user's exact wording
2. **STEP-BY-STEP**: Document every implementation step
3. **RATIONALE**: Explain why decisions were made
4. **TRACEABILITY**: Link requirements to implementation
5. **COMPLETENESS**: No gaps in the development story

### **TDD RULES:**
1. **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**: Always follow TDD cycle
2. **FAILING FIRST**: All tests must fail initially
3. **ONE AT A TIME**: Make one test pass before moving to next
4. **COMPREHENSIVE**: Test all expected functionality
5. **DOCUMENT FAILURES**: Record why tests fail and how they're fixed

---

## 🚀 **NEXT ACTIONS QUEUE**

**IMMEDIATE (RIGHT NOW):**
1. Create STEP_BY_STEP_CHECKLIST.md
2. Create MODULAR_CHECKLIST.md  
3. Create comprehensive failing test suite
4. Verify all tests fail as expected

**NEXT IN SEQUENCE:**
1. Design solver module architecture
2. Implement linear solver (first test passing)
3. Continue TDD cycle for all solver types
4. Document each implementation step

---

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS TRACKING**

**CURRENT METRICS:**
- Tests Created: 0 (target: 20+ comprehensive tests)
- Tests Passing: 0 (expected: 0 initially, then incremental)
- Documentation Files: 3 (target: 6+ complete documentation)
- User Requirements Captured: 100% ✅

**TARGET METRICS:**
- All solver tests created and initially failing
- TDD cycle documented step-by-step
- Complete equation solver module implemented
- Zero warnings maintained
- Performance benchmarks added

## 🎯 **AI SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS**

**BEFORE PROCEEDING, ASK:**
1. Have I preserved the user's exact words?
2. Am I following the TDD approach strictly?
3. Are all checklists updated?
4. Is everything documented step-by-step?
5. Am I creating files that prompt myself effectively?

**ANSWER ALL YES BEFORE CONTINUING** ✅
